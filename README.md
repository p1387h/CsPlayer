## Overview
The player was a learning project that I used in order to familiarize myself with the Prism framework. MahApps.Metro as well as the MahApps.Metro.IconPacks library are used for styling the application, while the GongSolutions.WPF.DragDrop library allows some simple drag and drop actions without hard-referencing the ViewModel from the View's code-behind file. Playing the audio file is accomplished by passing the file path to the NAudio library.
